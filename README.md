# Round_Robin-Scheduling-Algorithm
Round Robin is a <strong>CPU scheduling algorithm</strong> where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way.
<br>The fixed time slot is often refered to as <em><strong>quantum</strong></em>.
<br>Here I've implemented the Algorithm which also gives us the <strong>GANTT</strong> view of the processes getting scheduled
